# Greetings, Fellow Coders! ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
I'm Darrell, a passionate coder with a deep passion for technology. Since my early coding days, I've been immersed in various programming languages, with a special love for C and C++.

## Tech Stack
I thrive in:
- **Languages**: C, C++, Java, JavaScript, Lua, ASM, Python, TypeScript, Kotlin, Shell scripts, PowerShell scripts, VBA, Arduino, GLSL, HLSL.
- **Cloud Services**: Proficient in using cloud endpoints such as Amazon EC2, Vercel, and Google Compute.

## Highlights
- Crafted custom game engines (2D and 3D) with a focus on physics, rendering, and entity component systems, predominantly using C/C++.
- Explored networking projects involving MQTT, MySQL, SAP, Firebase, and RESTful APIs; covering web servers, VPNs, and hardware control through mobile apps.
- Delved into machine learning, creating systems like image classification for a drawer recognition project.
- Contributed to various RPA projects automating database tasks with Shell and PowerShell scripts.
- Designed and built hardware projects, including a custom 3D printer and a 3D printed bionic arm.
